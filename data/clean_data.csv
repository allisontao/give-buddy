AWA’s goal is to have 34% of the Boreal Forest, 90% of the Rockies, 79% of the Canadian Shield, 16% of the Grasslands, 20% of the Foothills, and 4% of the Parklands protected in the future.  To protect wild spaces, the charity advocates to the government and other regulatory agencies including in the form of letters, petitions, forums, and legal action. In F2022, the Grassy Mountain Coal Project, which AWA opposed, was successfully rejected. For wildlife conservation, AWA seeks protection for habitats of at-risk species through its Protected Areas. Current species of interest include bison, caribou, native cold-water fish, grizzly bears, sage-grouse, and wolves.

In F2022, it spent 55% of research costs on impact analysis and 35% on charity ratings and results reporting.  Ci’s charity profiles provide a summary of a given charity’s programs and spending. Each charity profile assesses its financial transparency, results reporting, need for funding, and cents to the cause. In F2022, Ci updated 436 charity reports, compared to 416 in F2021. Ci’s demonstrated impact ratings measure the social value that a charity produces for each dollar spent. As of F2022, Ci has 280 charities rated on impact.

DSF uses legal action to pressure the Canadian government to respond to climate change. In 2021, DSF’s advocacy led to Canada adding “plastic manufactured items” to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act's (CEPA) list of toxic substances. The Foundation also played a role in the introduction of a bill to modernize the CEPA which would make it the first Canadian law to recognize the right to a healthy environment.   DSF’s goal for thriving nature is to protect and restore Canada’s most at-risk ecosystems and species. Today, 521 plant and animal species are considered at risk under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

Youth come from marginalized backgrounds, often experiencing racial discrimination, exposure to violence and crime, family breakdown and social isolation. These youth, while often lacking resources and social support for developing their artistic talent, have confidence and passion. Led by teachers working in Toronto’s art sector, UforChange’s flagship program is a free, 8-week core art course (66% of F2017 program costs) offered in fashion, photography and DJing. UforChange’s youth are confident and focused on careers in the creative arts, yet many do not know where to start and how to start. Youth also lack the resources and tools for hands-on experience and practical training. UforChange provides these tools with Apple computers, cameras, sewing machines, and film editing software all in one supportive hub. In 2017, UforChange launched additional short workshops teaching business and entrepreneurial skills. In these core programs, in F2017, the graduation rates were 70% to 77%. Shift hour changes are a common reason for dropping out as youth cannot make the course schedule.   In 2017, UforChange taught 360 youth, compared with 379 in F2016 and 325 in F2015. Skills learned are shown once a year in UforChange’s multimedia showcase event, VivaCity, to an expected audience of 200 people (June 13, 2018). Despite training, it is hard to get a start in arts. UforChange recognized this and with 23 mentors provides hands-on jobs and also shares the soft skills required for success, like networking and promoting. Djing is UforChange’s most popular program. It offers a “master class” for 10 graduates, led by prominent Toronto DJ, L’Oqenz. UforChange is going through transition.

It also runs a 24-7 home care program, offers bereavement and counselling services, conducts research on best practices in pain and symptom management for palliative care, and educates doctors, caregivers, and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) through training programs and workshops.  VHS states that most of its services are free for clients. In keeping with BC government policies, there are daily charges for long-term and respite care beds in the in-patient unit at Royal Jubilee Hospital. The charity also states that some bereavement group services may include a charge to cover basic expenses.  Victoria Hospice Society’s in-patient unit admitted 455 people in F2020. Although the majority (70%) of VHS’ registered patients have cancer, VHS also helps people with diagnoses such as ALS or other chronic, progressive diseases. Referrals to the Hospice are made by Home & Community Care Nurses who work in partnership with VHS. The Hospice accepts patients in advanced stages of progressive illnesses who usually have a prognosis of six to 12 months. The unit has nine beds for ongoing end-of-life care (average length of stay of 24 days in F2020) seven beds for pain and symptom management (average length of stay was 9 days), and one bed for respite care to give caregivers one week of rest (average length of stay was 8 days).  The Palliative Response Team (PRT) is VHS’s home care program. Nurses, who are on-call 24-7, provide consultation and treatment to palliative patients in the comfort of their own homes, as well as counselling for patients and families. The Palliative Response Team made 1,296 home visits in F2020. Bereavement services are available to family members of registered patients as well as the general public. In F2020, the charity provided an average of 40 one-on-one counselling sessions every week. It also opened a new support and counselling centre.  VHS’s research and education program offers two flagship courses for healthcare professionals: Palliative Care: Medical Intensive and Psychosocial Care of the Dying and Bereaved. The charity also developed several other training workshops in F2020, including Palliative Care Pharmacy and Master Class in Palliative Care. These events had a total of 1,129 participants.  In its 2019-2024 strategic plan, VHS describes plans to find a new location for its inpatient care services and expand respite care services. It also plans to extend its home care program reach in the next five years by helping more people with pain and symptom management at home, psychosocial care at home, ambulatory clinics for palliative patients, and in-home respite care. Through a new navigation program, VHS hopes to have a single, consistent point of contact to access VHS’s patient and caregiver programs, and connect with patients and families at the time of diagnosis.","As part of its research activities, Victoria Hospice Society published two manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals in F2021 – one on grief related to medically assisted death, and another on differing attitudes towards covid-19 across demographic groups."
