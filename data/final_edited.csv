It does this by seeking protection for regions that represent the province's characteristic landscapes. AWA's major program is wilderness conservation, which it achieves through public awareness and action. AWA prioritizes six natural regions: the Boreal Forest, the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian Shield, the Grasslands, the Foothills, and the Parklands.

The charity is also fighting against a water pipeline proposal that would divert water from the Red Deer watershed. In F2022, 1,161 people attended Alberta Wilderness Association's events. The charity's Adventures for Wilderness program hosted 37 adventures. Additionally, AWA released four issues of its Wildlands Advocate magazine. Each issue was delivered to 2,200 individuals and accessed online by more people.

The charity is based in Vancouver, with offices in Toronto and Montreal. Of its total program spending, DSF allocated 32% to communications, education, and public engagement, 18% to science and policy, 20% to British Columbia and Western Canada, 16% to Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and 14% to Ontario and Northern Canada in F2021. DSF focuses its work on three main areas: climate solutions, thriving nature, and sustainable communities. The charity does not provide a breakdown of spending on these programs. David Suzuki Foundation's goal for climate solutions is to cut Canadian carbon pollution in half by 2030. DSF uses legal action to pressure the Canadian government to respond to climate change. In 2021, DSF's advocacy led to Canada adding ""plastic manufactured items"" to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act's (CEPA) list of toxic substances. The Foundation also played a role in the introduction of a bill to modernize the CEPA which would make it the first Canadian law to recognize the right to a healthy environment. DSF's goal for thriving nature is to protect and restore Canada's most at-risk ecosystems and species. Today, 521 plant and animal species are considered at risk under Canada's Species at Risk Act. The Foundation advocates for endangered and at-risk species, including marine life, butterflies, and caribou. In F2021, Blueberry River First Nations won an important ruling that stated the province of B.C. failed to uphold its treaty promises. DSF's Atlas of Cumulative Landscape Disturbance in the Traditional Territory of Blueberry River First Nations played a key role in convincing the court of this ruling.

During F2022, three new projects started, including the Boreal Wildlands. The Boreal Wildlands is now the biggest conservation agreement in Canada. Nature Conservancy of Canada led 28 collaborations with Indigenous communities in F2022. This was almost double the number of collaborations in F2021. NCC also had over 24,000 participants in educational and volunteering events. More than 1,000 people changed their land use techniques to better protect the ecosystem."

The charity is financially transparent and has a good results reporting grade. Excluding donor-endowed funds, its current funding reserves can cover annual program costs for 1.3 years. Founded in 1994, Nova Scotia Nature Trust (NSNT) works to conserve natural land across Nova Scotia, with a special focus on coastal habitats and old forests. The charity states that natural areas are particularly at risk in Nova Scotia, where 70% of land and 85% of the coastline is privately-owned. Compared to the rest of Canada, where 90% of land is held publicly, NSNT states that Nova Scotia has the highest rates of private land ownership. Nova Scotia Nature Trust runs three main programs: Land Conservation, Education and Outreach, and Land Stewardship. Land Conservation represented 85% of program spending in F2021. NSNT protects land in one of three ways. It offers Stewardship Agreements, which are informal arrangements that allow landowners to retain ownership while helping NSNT monitor their land. Nova Scotia Nature Trust also signs legal Conservation Agreements, which retain private ownership but grant more extensive rights and land access to the charity. Finally, NSNT offers Land Acquisition options that transfer land to the charity through donations, bequests, or sales. As of F2021, the charity reports that it now holds 120 conservation lands, spanning 18,267 acres. Education and Outreach programs were 8% of program spending in F2021. These programs include educational resources and opportunities for community members to visit and explore conserved lands.

Veterans often struggle with finding jobs, reconnecting with family, and develop issues with substance abuse. Recent News: Veterans Transition Network is currently fundraising to support the evacuation of Afghani people who helped the Canadian Armed Forces from 2001-2014. An ad hoc group of Canadian veterans are working to relocate these Afghans and their families to places where they can be safely extracted by the Canadian government. VTN currently estimates the cost of protecting a single family at $5,400/month. Any excess funds raised at the end of this campaign will go towards helping Afghans resettle in Canada. Veteran Transition Program (VTP) is VTN's flagship program. It is a 10-day recovery program delivered over three weekends that helps veterans connect to peers, practice open communication, and develop productive plans for the future. In F2020, VTN ran VTP 6 times to help a total of 20 veterans. In past years it has reached more than 100 veterans, but VTP was cancelled for most of 2020 due to covid-19. To replace VTP during covid-19, VTN adapted the same clinical support to a 5-day format and called it the Transition Skills Course.

Its mission is to improve the quality of life for people dealing with life-limiting illness, death, and bereavement. VHS runs a 17-bed inpatient unit at Royal Jubilee Hospital for respite care, pain and symptom management, and ongoing end-of-life care. It also runs a 24-7 home care program, offers bereavement and counselling services, conducts research on best practices in pain and symptom management for palliative care, and educates doctors, caregivers, and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) through training programs and workshops. VHS states that most of its services are free for clients. In keeping with BC government policies, there are daily charges for long-term and respite care beds in the in-patient unit at Royal Jubilee Hospital. The charity also states that some bereavement group services may include a charge to cover basic expenses. Victoria Hospice Society's in-patient unit admitted 455 people in F2020. Although the majority (70%) of VHS' registered patients have cancer, VHS also helps people with diagnoses such as ALS or other chronic, progressive diseases. Referrals to the Hospice are made by Home & Community Care Nurses who work in partnership with VHS. The Hospice accepts patients in advanced stages of progressive illnesses who usually have a prognosis of six to 12 months. The unit has nine beds for ongoing end-of-life care (average length of stay of 24 days in F2020) seven beds for pain and symptom management (average length of stay was 9 days), and one bed for respite care to give caregivers one week of rest (average length of stay was 8 days). The Palliative Response Team (PRT) is VHS's home care program. Nurses, who are on-call 24-7, provide consultation and treatment to palliative patients in the comfort of their own homes, as well as counselling for patients and families. The Palliative Response Team made 1,296 home visits in F2020. Bereavement services are available to family members of registered patients as well as the general public. In F2020, the charity provided an average of 40 one-on-one counselling sessions every week. It also opened a new support and counselling centre. VHS's research and education program offers two flagship courses for healthcare professionals: Palliative Care: Medical Intensive and Psychosocial Care of the Dying and Bereaved. The charity also developed several other training workshops in F2020, including Palliative Care Pharmacy and Master Class in Palliative Care. These events had a total of 1,129 participants. In its 2019-2024 strategic plan, VHS describes plans to find a new location for its inpatient care services and expand respite care services. It also plans to extend its home care program reach in the next five years by helping more people with pain and symptom management at home, psychosocial care at home, ambulatory clinics for palliative patients, and in-home respite care. Through a new navigation program, VHS hopes to have a single, consistent point of contact to access VHS's patient and caregiver programs, and connect with patients and families at the time of diagnosis.","Founded in 1980, Victoria Hospice Society (VHS) provides end-of-life care to residents of Greater Victoria.

It has an average results reporting score, low overhead spending, and is financially transparent. Founded in 2004, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada (WCS Canada) is the Canadian branch of Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates in over 60 countries. WCS Canada uses research and advocacy to protect wildlife. Its work focuses on Northern Ontario, boreal forests, and the Arctic Ocean. WCS Canada's research aims to learn more about at-risk species and the threats they face. WCS Canada runs three main programs: National Conservation & Policy, Boreal Forests, and Western Arctic. National Conservation and Policy made up 40% of program spending in F2022 ($2.5m). WCS Canada is a leader of Canada's Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) Program. This is part of the global initiative to protect areas with threatened biodiversity. As of F2022, WCS Canada has helped over 70 sites become KBAs. In F2022, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada released 27 policy comments. It hopes that these comments will help advocate for more environmentally friendly laws. Boreal Forests represented 31% of program costs ($1.9m). These programs conduct research to protect at-risk species and habitats in Ontario, BC, and Yukon. In F2022, WCS Canada tracked 19 new wolverines and 45 new lake sturgeon. Tracking animals gives information about their living patterns. WCS Canada also funded 13 students through its Weston Family Boreal Research fellowship. Western Arctic programs were 19% of costs in F2022 ($1.2m). In F2022, WCS Canada started a project on how white-nose syndrome impacts Canadian bats. It surveyed over 500 bridges to understand living patterns of bats. WCS Canada also continued research in the Arctic Ocean to see how underwater noise affects aquatic life. In F2022, it published four articles about this topic. The remaining spending for Wildlife Conservation Society Canada includes Outside Canada (7% - $470k) and the Next Generation of Conservation Scientists (3% - $197k). WCS Canada sends funds to other Wildlife Conservation Societies to support global work. As of F2022, WCS Canada has provided research fellowships to 86 graduate students. Included in WCS Canada's main programs are grants of $570,000 made to other Canadian charities, primarily Bird Studies Canada ($215,000), Nature Serve ($137,000) for nature data collection and resources, and smaller grants to Canadian universities for research.","Wildlife Conservation Society Canada is a 4-star charity.

It is Canada's largest international food charity helping those at risk of starvation and malnutrition, especially in fragile communities. Founded in 1957, World Vision Canada (WVC) is a Christian international development and disaster relief charity. It aims to help communities overcome poverty. World Vision Canada is the Canadian chapter of World Vision International. WVC's work focuses on hunger and malnutrition, especially among children.

World Vision Canada breaks its program spending down into five main programs: Livelihoods (54% of program spending). World Vision is the largest partner to distribute UN's World Food Program aid. Through this WFP partnership, World Vision Canada WVC distributed 67,690 metric tons of food that reached 1,950,835 people in fiscal 2022. It also gave $68m in cash transfers and vouchers to 1,454,557 people. The value of cash and vouchers alone is 18% of total program spending. On average, each person received $47 in cash and vouchers.
