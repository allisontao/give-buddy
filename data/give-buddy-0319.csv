Founded in 1987, Moisson Mauricie / Centre-du-Quebec (MME) is the only food bank serving the Mauricie and Centre-du-Quebec area. MME collects, recovers, and distributes food to partner organizations that assist economically and socially disadvantaged people in the area. Moisson Mauricie's social integration and employment program allows community members to gain work experience by assisting the charity with its services. Employees sort and distribute food and prepare orders for charities in Moisson Mauricie's network. The goal is for employees to develop transferable skills that they can use elsewhere.",819-371-7778,QC,4,"Moisson Mauricie reports that nearly 31,500 people accessed food support services in Mauricie/Centre-du-Quebec in F2022, a 16% increase compared with F2021. Moisson Mauricie also runs a social integration and employment program to help employees develop transferable skills. The charity reports that it helped 31,500 people a month or 378,000 people a year. The charity is part of Food Banks Canada and Food Banks of Quebec's networks.

In F2022, MME collected 6.4 million lb of food from 73 suppliers and redistributed 6.3 million lb to 70 member organisations. The charity collected 44% of food locally, from stores, farmers and other local suppliers.

The charity provided 51 boxes filled with basic supplies such as hygiene products and food, which helped 138 people. Moisson Mauricie collects food from supermarkets and redistributes it to its networks. This avoids food waste and increases the variety of food the charity provides. In F2022, the charity reports saving 143 thousand lb of food from 46 participating stores. 39% of this food was meat and meat alternatives. In F2022, Moisson Mauricie's social integration and employment program had 389 people participate, providing 28,982 hours of work.

Aid,"Founded in 2006, Against Malaria Foundation Canada (AMFC) raises money to buy mosquito nets that prevent the spread of malaria. Malaria kills 400,000 people and infects more than 200 million people each year. Around 90% of deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and 70% of deaths are children under five.",207-371-8735,ON,4,"AMFC highlights that it uses 100% of public donations to buy long-lasting insecticide-treating nets (LLINs). AMFC is a fundraising branch of Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), based in the United Kingdom. AMF's cost per net is C$2.50. Each net lasts up to four years, protecting an average of two people. Against Malaria Foundation aims to assess program effectiveness by visiting randomly selected households every six months after receiving nets.

73,5,Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society,Calgary,100,https://partners.givingtuesday.ca/gtuploads/partners/logo-1701116522589.png,Animal Welfare,"Founded in 2006 and based in Calgary, Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society (AARCS) rescues homeless animals throughout the province. The charity's shelter is a temporary, emergency, and quarantine shelter. Its Rescue & Transport team travelled 68,618 km in 2020 to rescue animals. These animals are brought to the shelter, which has an in-house veterinary hospital. Its hospital has two surgical suites, a dental suite, a full-body x-ray machine, a laboratory, and a pharmacy. AARCS does not provide a breakdown of its spending on its programs.",403-250-7377,AB,5,"During F2020, AARCS's shelter took in 1,499 dogs, 2,307 cats, and 47 other animals. AARCS received over 15,000 applications for dogs and cats compared to 7,158 applications in 2019. While in the shelter, animals are not available for adoption. Instead, the animals stay in the shelter for an average of 43 days before staying at one of AARCS's foster homes while they waitÂ for adoption. The charity had 467 new foster homes for dogs and 174 for cats. The charity reports most new foster homes adopt their foster animal. The shelter's hospital performed 2,603 spays and neuters, 288 dental surgeries and 491 other surgeries in F2020. The clinic also gave 10,295 vaccines andÂ 11,207 examsÂ for a total of 24,884 vet services. This is a slight decrease from 25,916 in F2019. AARCS's other programs include a pet food bank,Â a Trap-Neuter-Return program, humane education programs, and animal disaster response. Trap-Neuter-Return neutered or spayed 352 feral cats in F2020, a 72% increase over 99 in F2019. AARCS also provided food and pet supplies to over 240 families. In 2021, AARCS completed building a new animal shelter in Edmonton.

in 1965, Alberta Wilderness Association'sÂ (AWA) mission is to preserve Alberta'sÂ wilderness, water, and wildlife. It does this byÂ seekingÂ protection forÂ regions that represent the province's characteristic landscapes. AWA's major program isÂ wildernessÂ conservation, which it achieves through public awareness and action. AWAÂ prioritizesÂ sixÂ naturalÂ regions: the Boreal Forest, the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian Shield, the Grasslands, the Foothills, and the Parklands. AWA proposes areas for conservation for each of these regions. AWA's goal is to have 34% of the Boreal Forest, 90% of the Rockies, 79% of the Canadian Shield, 16% of the Grasslands, 20% of the Foothills, and 4% of the Parklands protected in the future. To protect wild spaces, the charity advocates to the government and other regulatory agencies including in the form of letters, petitions, forums, and legal action. In F2022, the Grassy Mountain Coal Project, which AWA opposed, was successfully rejected. ForÂ wildlife conservation, AWAÂ seeksÂ protectionÂ forÂ habitats of at-risk species through its Protected Areas. Current species of interest include bison, caribou, native cold-water fish, grizzly bears, sage-grouse, and wolves. AWA also advocates for improved species-at-risk legislation in Alberta and enforcement of existing laws to protect at-risk species. To protect freshwater in Alberta, AWA advocates for a stronger provincial wetland policy. AWA currently prioritizes the McClelland Lake wetlands, Wood Buffalo National Park, and the Peace-Athabasca Delta, which face immediate threats. The charity is also fighting against a water pipeline proposal that would divert water from the Red Deer watershed.",403-283-2025,AB,5,"In F2022, 1,161 people attended Alberta Wilderness Association's events. The charity's Adventures for Wilderness program hosted 37 adventures. Additionally, AWA released four issues of its Wildlands Advocate magazine. Each issue was delivered to 2,200 individuals and accessed online by more people. The charity also launched a Leave No Trace campaign to remind people to minimise any negative impact on places they visit.",80,"Nature conservation, Environmental education and awareness, animal protection",www.albertawilderness.ca

For detox patients needing extended support, there are 12 beds in the transitional program. In F2021, the Detox Program served 896 people, although the charity states that covid-19 affected this number. Through its Housing Program, Alpha House supports recovering addicts in finding and maintaining long-term accommodation. The charity provides different levels of support depending on client needs. For those who can live independently, Alpha House helps coordinate leases with landlords. The charity offers 24-hour care in its five long-term housing buildings. One of the buildings is for veterans and the newest house is women-only. In April 2020, Alpha House added a Transitional Housing Program, which supports individuals currently experiencing homelessness and transitioning into long-term housing. In total, the charity reports that its Housing Program served 295 people in F2020. Alpha House's Outreach Teams respond to street level issues through mobile response units. The Downtown Outreach Addiction Partnership Team (DOAP Team) deals with addiction and public intoxication. Alpha House reports that the DOAP Team served 3,685 individuals in 2020. The Encampment Team helps people experiencing homelessness find housing. Finally, the Needle Response Team cleans up needles and needle debris around the community. In F2021, the team collected 56,720 needles.",20,"Rehabilitation centers and addiction services, Homelessness and housing assistance, mental wellness",www.alphahousecalgary.com

in 1948, Atlantic Salmon Federation Canada (ASF Canada) works to protect salmon and their habitats. Currently, illegal fishing and habitat destruction kill thousands of salmon each year. ASF Canada shares a close relationship with Atlantic Salmon Federation US (ASF US). The two charities share a website and publish combined annual reports. ASF Canada runs three main programs: Research, Conservation, and Education. Research represented 43% of program costs in F2022. Through its research projects, ASF Canada monitors Atlantic salmon health and ocean conditions. It hopes to find the causes of declining salmon populations.",800-565-5666,NB,4,"In F2022, the charity tagged 209 fish in Greenland and 1,383 fish along Atlantic Canadian rivers. Conservation projects represented 40% of F2022 program spending. Within this program, ASF Canada focuses on political advocacy and habitat restoration projects. In F2022, the charity ran a 300-person survey about public opinions on protected areas. This survey influenced the New Brunswick government to protect 377,900 more hectares of land. With restoration, ASF Canada hosted a workday to eradicate invasive smallmouth bass. Education received the final 16% of program costs in F2022. ASF Canada runs the Wild Salmon Nature Centre that offers exhibits and tours of salmon habitats. The Centre was closed this year due to covid-19. ASF Canada also publishes reports and runs education programs to engage Canadians. In F2022, the charity published 14 news releases about its work.",40,"Nature conservation, Animal Protection, Environmental education and awareness",www.asf.ca

Aunt Leah's Place gives youth the skills and support they need to live independently. As well, by giving housing and guidance to young mothers, the charity reduces the number of children entering the foster care system. Aunt Leah's runs four major programs: Housing, Education, Employment and Life Skills. Aunt Leah's Place has low funding reserves, indicating a need for funding.",604-525-1204,BC,5,"In F2022, the charity supported 620 people, a 53% increase over 404 people in F2021. Housing accounts for 68% ($3.0m) of program spending in F2022. The charity runs six housing programs to provide housing to youth and families at risk. In F2022, 117 people were housed and 241 youth were helped to keep their housing. The Threshold program houses teen moms in foster care and adult moms at risk of losing custody of their children. In F2022, Aunt Leah's supported 14 young mothers and their 18 children. The Friendly Landlord Network program is a grouping of private landlords who provide housing subsidies to former foster kids pursuing an education. Currently, the program has 25 landlords with 25 houses and 43 apartments. Education accounts for 13% ($587k) of program spending. The education programs aim to help Aunt Leah's clients graduate High School or reach other education goals. In F2022, 140 youth enrolled or re-enrolled in the program. Employment accounts for 13% ($584k) of program spending. Aunt Leah's helps youth find sustainable employment and avoid homelessness. In F2022, 71 youth accessed resume building, job training, job search support, connection to employers and other services. Aunt Leah's also runs a thrift store and a Christmas tree store. These businesses employ and train at-risk youth. Life Skills programs accounted for the final 6% (258k) of program spending in F2022. The programs aim to equip youth with the skills needed to live independently. Community workshops, creative activities, and counselling are available every Wednesday and Sunday. A 12-week cooking program teaches young moms how to prepare inexpensive and nutritious meals. In F2022, the charity delivered 2,627 meals and counselling sessions to 200 people.

80,17,Bladder Cancer Canada,Toronto,100,https://bladdercancercanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dummyimagestaff.jpg,Health,"Founded in 2009 by two Canadians diagnosed with bladder cancer, Bladder Cancer Canada (BCC) aims to improve the level of support available for those diagnosed with the disease. BCC reports there are currently 80,000 Canadians living with bladder cancer with 12,000 diagnoses annually. Blader cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Canada. BCC reports that it is highly underfunded, ranking 21st out of the top 25 research funded cancers. Due to a high recurrence rate of 60-70%, bladder cancer is also the most expensive cancer type to treat on a per-patient basis. Bladder Cancer Canada's mission is three-fold: support bladder cancer patients; increase awareness and education; and fund bladder cancer research. These pillars align with the charity's three program areas: Research, Awareness, and Patient Support.",866-674-8889,ON,4,"Research represents 47% of program spending in F2020. The charity reports it spent $253k on research in F2020. However, the charity's financial statements report research expenses of $128k and a $100k grant to Canadian Bladder Cancer Information System (CBCIS). BCC distributes annual $50,000 grants for basic bladder cancer research. In F2020, Dr. Black and Dr. Eigl from the University of British Columbia both received a grant. The researchers are working with genes that can promote cancer growth and identify bladder cancer treatments. Both recipients are members of the charity's Medical Advisory and Research Board. Bladder Cancer Canada is a major sponsor of CBCIS, which launched in F2014. CBCIS is a database that collects treatment outcome data on bladder cancer patients from 14 health centers across Canada. The goal is to use this data to improve treatment and clinical management practices for patients. The database has information from over 5,400 patients as of F2020. Awareness represents 42% of program spending in F2020. BCC works with patients, doctors, and the general public to increase awareness about bladder cancer. BCC has 2,024 Facebook followers and 448 Instagram followers, a 5% and 30% increase over F2019 respectively. The charity's website received 223,340 views in F2020. BCC reports it launched a bladder cancer blog in December of 2020 and a podcast for Bladder Cancer Awareness Month in May. Patient Support accounts for the final 11% of program spending in F2020. BCC posts online resources, hosts meetings and webinars, runs an online discussion forum, and provides one-to-one support through its One2One program. The online discussion forum had 4,975 visits in F2020, a 15% increase over F2019. The charity also distributed 9,482 patient guidebooks.",0,"Cancer, Health education and awareness charities, Medical research, Patient support and advocacy charities",www.bladdercancercanada.org

Boundless School was founded as an outdoor adventureÂ centreÂ for at-risk youthÂ in 1984. The charity can award high school credits, allowing teens to achieve academic successÂ in what the charity describes as an exquisite non-traditionalÂ learning environment. Boundless has two buildings on 600 acres of land in Palmer Rapids, Ontario. The property includes 3,000 feet of Madawaska River shoreline.

Services,"Founded in 1979, Children's Aid Foundation of Canada (CAFC) works to improve the lives of children and youth in the child welfare system. CAFC states that young people in government care are 200 times more likely to experience homelessness and enrol in post-secondary education at half the rate of the general population. According to the charity, as many as 82% of children in care have been diagnosed with special needs. CAFC tailors its work to three main groups: children and families at risk, children and youth in care, and youth transitioning out of care.",416-923-0924,ON,4,"In F2023, CAFC granted $4.7m to 34 programs forÂ youth transitioning out of care. The charity states that roughly 2,300 Canadian youth ""age out"" of the child welfare system each year and have toÂ leave government care. These former foster care kids are more likely to suffer from alcoholism, drug abuse, and depression as adults. Additionally, youth from care earn an average of $326,000 less incomeÂ throughout their lifetime. To combat these barriers, CAFC provides employment services, post-secondary scholarships and awards, mental health resources, housing support, and life skills development. In F2023, CAFC supportedÂ 3,936 youth transitioning out of care. In F2023, CAFC granted $2.7m to 19 programs forÂ children and families at riskÂ of entering the welfareÂ system. The charity reports that 235,000 children and youth across Canada are at risk of abuse, neglect, or abandonment. CAFC aims to prevent children from separating from their families and entering the welfare system through early intervention programs, health and wellness support, and financial support. In F2023, CAFC supported 2,800 families. CAFC granted $2.7m toÂ 24 programs for children and youth in careÂ in F2023. According to the charity, over 63,000 children and youth in CanadaÂ live in foster homes, institutional settings, or with extended family because of neglect, abuse, or abandonment. CAFC helps these children access the resources and support they need to succeed in school, such as mentoring, extracurricular activities, technology, and transportation. In F2023, CAFC helped 8,366 children and youth in government care. In F2023, the charity also invested $2.4m in nine Black-focused initiatives and ten Indigenous-focused initiatives. CAFC reports that 33% of the families and youth supported by its programs identify as Indigenous, and 20% identify as Black.",60,"Child welfare, youth programs, mental wellness",www.cafdn.org

Book believes that education is a child's best path out of poverty, but access to quality education is not equal. The charity states that almost 25% of Canadian households do not own a single book, and 30% of Canadian Grade 3 students lack basic literacy skills. Additionally, schools in disadvantaged communities can only afford one new library book for every three children, and one-third of Canadian public school students live in low-income households. The National Book Bank is a centralized system that offers large quantities of publisher-donated books for only the cost of shipping. Pop-up book distributions are in-community events that allow local educators and program leaders to choose from thousands of books for children. The Marketplace is a member-only online store offering children's books and educational materials at 50-90% off retail prices. Reading celebrations are events across Canada where students attend inspiring presentations by authors or illustrators.",866-732-3669,ON,5,"First Book Canada reports that since 2009, it has distributed more than seven million books and educational resources to programs and schools serving children from low-income families in Canada. In F2021, First Book Canada distributed 1.6 million books and reached 500,000 children and youth across Canada. The charity also held nine pop-up events and 40 reading celebrations. The First Book Canada network is made up of educators, program leaders, health service providers, and professionals who serve children in need. First Book Canada recently reported that there are 14,843 network members across Canada.",80,Education access and equity ,www.firstbookcanada.org

The Food Bank distributes food to a network of 100+ community programs as well as provincial partners.",519-743-5576,ON,4,"In F2021, the Community Food Assistance Program served 35k men, women and children in the Waterloo Region. The Food Bank's main program is food collection and distribution. In F2021, the charity acquired, coordinated, and distributed 6.8m pounds of food to community programs and provincial partners. This is a 45% increase in food distributed compared to F2020. 64% of the food acquired and distributed was fresh or frozen. The Food Bank distributed 1.4m pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to community programs in F2021. This represented an 8% increase from F2020. In F2021, the charity also packed and distributed 37k fresh food hampers and 15k non-perishable food hampers. 31 different food hamper programs received essential food to assist program participants. 14k households received emergency food assistance in F2021. Of the people served by the community network in the Waterloo Region, 35% were under the age of 18 and 47% were single people living alone.

The charity reports that 50% of the world's population lacks access to essential health services. The charity receives donations of medicine and supplies from Canadian pharmaceutical organizations and then sendsÂ them to international aid charities and local health partners. Applicants can customize the contents of bulk shipments to serve a community's needs. Medicine is shipped directly from Canada.",514-822-1112,QC,4,"The charityÂ delivered treatmentsÂ to 30 countries in F2021. In F2021, HPIC gave away $16.4m in medical supplies and equipment to 14 Canadian charities. Its three largest grant recipients were Food for the Poor Canada ($7.5m), Hope and Healing International ($5.2m), and Children Believe ($1.5m). HPIC has five main programs: Access to Medicine, Women's and Children's Health, Emergency Response, Pharmaceutical Management, and Non-Communicable Diseases. The charity does not disclose how much it spent on each program. Through its Access to Medicine program, Health Partners International provides primary and specialized care kits. The charity's primary care kits are portable packs of essential medicines and supplies. One kit can provide up to 600 medical treatments. HPIC also works with local governments and health facilities to deliver needed drugs and supplies for specializedÂ needsÂ such as vision, palliative, surgical, and mental health care. HPIC operates a Women's and Children's Health program where the charity trains nurses, midwives, and other frontline health workers in child health services. In F2021, HPIC trained 206 health workers. Additionally, the charity distributes mother-child kits, newborn kits, and menstrual supplies. Through its Emergency Response program, the charity works with local partners to provide direct medical relief, train frontline workers, and raise awareness of health risks. In response to the conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, HPIC sent $48k worth of medicines to the Tigray region, reaching 6,000 people in F2021. Health Partners International'sÂ Pharmaceutical Management program provides training programs and tools to assist health providers in enhancing practices to ensure better access to medicine in the long term. The charity's program to address Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) is its final main area of program spending.

Services,"Founded in 2014, HeroWorkÂ Program SocietyÂ (HeroWork)Â renovates charity buildings inÂ and around Victoria,Â BC. HeroWork reports that it uses its network of skilled volunteersÂ to makeÂ improvements using onlyÂ a fraction of the time andÂ moneyÂ that would normally be needed. HeroWork reports that 36% of charities in its area urgently need renovations, and 55%Â of charitiesÂ believe that a renovation wouldÂ increase their ability to do their work. HeroWork coordinatesÂ corporate sponsors andÂ large groups of volunteers, many with specialized training in the trades,Â to fully renovate charity buildings inÂ just a couple of weeks.",250-590-4221,BC,5,"In F2020, HeroWorkÂ renovated the Kiwanis Young Families' Centre,Â which provides housing and support to young single mothers. HeroWork estimatesÂ thatÂ its renovationsÂ hadÂ a market value of $633k. ThroughÂ HeroWork, the charity only paidÂ $193k. HeroWorkÂ added 2 new suites to theÂ building, increasing itsÂ housingÂ capacity by 25%. It also renovated bathrooms,Â fixed rot and foundation issues, andÂ created a ""free store""Â in the basementÂ to help the Young Families'Â Centre distribute kids' clothes and other goods. HeroWork estimates that these renovations will affect 60 young families each year. The charity had to change its model slightly to keep its volunteers safe during covid-19. It postponed one of its planned F2020 projects to F2021. In F2021 it is back to a normal level of productivity,Â working with the Salvation ArmyÂ recoveryÂ centreÂ in Spring 2021 and the Indigenous Perspectives Society inÂ theÂ Fall. HeroWork has ambitious plans for expansion. While it currentlyÂ onlyÂ hasÂ one working chapter, it plans to open a new chapter on the BC Mainland inÂ F2021,Â with the goal of opening 10 chapters in 10Â Canadian cities in the next 10 years. In response to the covid-19 pandemic,Â HeroWorkÂ teamed up with other Victoria charities toÂ collect andÂ distributeÂ 640Â sleeping bagsÂ and tentsÂ andÂ 28,573Â hygiene items for homeless people.",80,Women Support Services,www.herowork.com

in 1973, Huntington Society of Canada (HSC) helps people and families affected by Huntington's disease (HD). HSC's goal is for a world free from Huntington's disease. One out of every 7,000 Canadians has HD. Every child with a parent with this genetic brain disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. HD presents in stages, with symptoms progressing from difficulties recalling information to loss of the ability to manage daily living activities. There is no known cure for HD. HSC's three main programsÂ areÂ Family Services, Research, and Public Awareness and Education.",800-998-7398,ON,4,"Family Services:Â Family Services was HSC's largest program in F2020, accounting for 52% of spending. This program supports individuals, families, and professionals who are directly affected by Huntington's disease. The program works to maximize the quality of life for people living with HD. Some of the services offered are education, short-term counselling and referrals to community resources. Support for caregivers of people with HD and advocacy for HD are also components of this program. In F2020, HSC supported 3,910 individuals and families. As well, 121 support group sessions were held, and a HD Facebook support group was established which now has 300 members. Since 2014, 48 mentees have been matched with mentors under the Mentorship Program. Research:Â HSC's Research program accounts for 35% of program spending in F2020. The Research programÂ funds clinical trials and clinical fellowships geared towards reversing, slowing, or preventing the progression of HD. In F2020, HSC provided two young neurologists $60k for their clinical fellowships in the HD research field. The charity also spent $915k on fundingÂ research projects, primarily clinical trials which are testing HD drugs. Public Awareness and Education: HSC's Public Awareness and Education program accounts for 12% of program spending. This program works to inform the public about HD and advocates for people living with the disease.

Canada's mission is to ""provide immediate response in times of disaster, and to implement programs that alleviate human suffering"". ICNA Relief Canada (ICNA Relief) is the department of ICNA Canada that delivers humanitarian relief and development programs, accounting for the majority of ICNA Canada's mission activities.",905-257-4262,ON,4,"ICNA Canada spent $10.2 million on programs in F2020, including $6.0 million internationally. $8.5 million was spent on ICNA Relief's activities in F2020. ICNA Relief works to reduce human suffering, helping the poor regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, cultural background or political affiliation. ICNA Relief Canada's 2020 annual report states that $1.3 million was spent on international disaster and emergency responses. This includes an ongoing response in Bangladesh for Rohingya refugees. So far, ICNA Canada has brought 17 Rohingya families to settle in Canada. In F2020, the charity built 4 children care homes to protect and educate 1,000 Rohingya children. ICNA Canada has built thousands of shelters, provided food and set up three medical camps. ICNA Canada also spent $1.9m on itsÂ international orphan sponsorship program. 5,573 orphans from 17 different countries were sponsored in F2020. The charity spent $457k on educational relief for over 100,000 children in F2020. It built a Center of Excellence for Orphans in Pakistan which is a school and housing facility for 500 students. It built threeÂ Mother and Child Health Centres in Pakistan and built twoÂ mobile dental clinics. The charity also built one hospital in India for a community of over one million people living in extremely poor conditions. In Canada, ICNA Relief runs ten resource centres in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia. These centres offer 13 programs, a food bank, family services, seniors support, matrimonial services, funeral support, foster parenting, Zakat, youth programs, women's shelter, emergency relief, settlement and refugee sponsorship (SRS), healthcare, feed the hungry, and emergency relief. ICNA Relief reports that its 11Â food banks served over 44,250 individuals (11,241 families) in F2020. Through the SRS program, sponsor groups provide full settlement and financial support to refugee families for at least one year once they arrive in Canada. In F2020, the charity settled three families in Canada, and it supported 100 Syrian refugee families.",20,Muslim,www.icnareliefcanada.ca
82,117,Indspire,Ohsweken,100,https://bigbrothersbigsisters.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Indspire-logo-BL-small.png,Social Services,"Founded in 1985, Indspire helps Indigenous students in Canada complete their education by providing funding and other resources. The charity's head office is in Ohsweken, Ontario. Overall, 44% of Indigenous students complete post-secondary credentials compared with 63% of non-Indigenous students. For Indigenous students, lack of funding is one of the biggest barriers to completing post-secondary education. The Centre for the Study of Living Standards estimates that higher education for Indigenous peoples would increase their average annual income by $11,236 by 2031. Closing the education gap for Indigenous students in Canada by 2026 could increase Canadian GDP by more than $400 billion. Indspire grants bursaries, scholarships and awards to Indigenous students needing financial aid to complete post-secondary education. In F2022, BFF awarded over $23m toÂ 6,612 students. Building Brighter Futures represents the largest scholarship and bursary program for Indigenous students in Canada after the Government of Canada. The three most popular areas of study for students receiving funding wereÂ health, business, and education.",855-463-7747,ON,5,"Indspire AwardsÂ represented 7% of program costs in F2022. In F2022, 12Â First Nations, Inuit, and MetisÂ individualsÂ received awards for their outstanding achievements. TheÂ Student SuccessÂ program represented 10% of program costs in F2022. This program was created in F2020, following the completion of Indspire's K-12 Indspire Institute program. Included is Rivers to Success, an Indigenous student mentorship program that offers support, skill-development workshops and resources to students. The program had over 2,000 participants in F2022. In F2022, the charity also held its National Gathering for Indigenous Education. The charity states that this event is an annual conference for educators and others who work with K-12 Indigenous students to improve their educational outcomes. In F2022, the event was held virtually for the second time and had 1,280 attendees. The charity also hosted its Virtual Summit in F2022, which featured three plenary sessions and three roundtable discussions on improving Indigenous education. The summit was attended by over 400 participants. SoaringÂ is Indspire's annual Indigenous Youth Career Conference, which educates high school students on career and education options. The conference made up 3% of program costs inÂ F2022 and was attended by 978 students. TheÂ Research Knowledge NestÂ (RN) hopes to create Indigenous participation in research and data science. The charity reports an absence of tracked post-secondary and workplace data for Indigenous students in Canada.

Aid,"Founded in 1959, Primate's World Relief Development Fund (PWRDF) is a charity of the Anglican church. It works to improve health, food security, and lives around the world. PWRDF funds programs both globally and in Canada. Primate's World Relief Development Fund's two main programs are Development and Humanitarian Relief and Responses.",416-924-9199,ON,4,"In F2022, PWRDF funded 80 projects in 33 countries. On average, each project received $86k in funding. Development (60% of program costs - $3.9m). Food Security: PWRDF works to train farmers in strategies that can reduce the effect of climate change on growing food. InÂ F2022, the largest project PWRDF funded was in South Sudan with a budget of $1.2m. Global Affairs Canada helped fund this project. Canadian Foodgrains Bank and Fin Church Aid gave cash grants to 600 families that returned to South Sudan from Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. It also gave seeds and farming training to 2,600 households. Preventative Health: PWRDF works to improve health to reduce poverty. For example, in Lesotho, PWRDF funds Partners In Health (PIH), a Boston-based charity. Partners In Health trains assistants that go with pregnant patients to the local health centre for appointments and births. This aims to reduce the number of home births. Of 141 women who gave birth last year, only three were home births. Empowering Women:Â PWRDF aims to improve the lives of women and girls to benefit the entire community. InÂ Zambia, for example, PWRDF funded nine safe spaces to support survivors of forced marriage and teen mothers. 359 people participated in weekly group meetings. Indigenous Programs: PWRDF supports Indigenous partners both in Canada and internationally. For example, in Pikangikum First Nation in Ontario, 400 of 500 homes do not have indoor plumbing or running water. PWRDF funded 20 water systems for the homes without water access.

Youth come from marginalized backgrounds, often experiencing racial discrimination, exposure to violence and crime, family breakdown and social isolation. These youth, while often lacking resources and social support for developing their artistic talent, have confidence and passion. Led by teachers working in Toronto's art sector, UforChange's flagship program is a free, 8-week core art course (66% of F2017 program costs) offered in fashion, photography and DJing. UforChange's youth are confident and focused on careers in the creative arts, yet many do not know where to start and how to start. Youth also lack the resources and tools for hands-on experience and practical training. UforChange provides these tools with Apple computers, cameras, sewing machines, and film editing software all in one supportive hub. In 2017, UforChange launched additional short workshops teaching business and entrepreneurial skills.",647-478-4591,ON,4,"In these core programs, in F2017, the graduation rates were 70% to 77%. Shift hour changes are a common reason for dropping out as youth cannot make the course schedule. Despite training, it is hard to get a start in arts.

It offers a ""master class"" for 10 graduates, led by prominent Toronto DJ, L'Oqenz. UforChange is going through transition. With the end of government funding, UforChange is now run entirely by volunteers and depends on donations for operations. Results and Impact: Based on an independent program evaluation done by Mendicant Group in 2016, 100% of participants would recommend UforChange to a friend, and 95% found that the programs and workshops taught them new skills.",80,Youth programs,www.uforchange.org

Services,"Founded inÂ 2012, Veterans Transition Network (VTN) is Canada's only evidence-based veteransÂ reintegration and recovery program. VTN reports that one third of CanadianÂ veteransÂ haveÂ difficulty transitioning to civilian life. Veterans oftenÂ struggle withÂ finding jobs, reconnecting with family, andÂ develop issues withÂ substance abuse. Recent News:Â Veterans Transition NetworkÂ is currently fundraising to support the evacuation of Afghani people who helpedÂ the CanadianÂ ArmedÂ ForcesÂ from 2001-2014. An ad hoc group of Canadian veterans are working to relocate theseÂ Afghans and their families to places where they can be safely extracted by the Canadian government. VTN currently estimates the cost of protecting a single family at $5,400/month. Any excess funds raised at the end of this campaign will go towards helping Afghans resettle in Canada. Veteran Transition Program (VTP) is VTN'sÂ flagship program. It is a 10-day recovery program delivered over three weekends that helps veterans connect to peers, practice open communication, and develop productiveÂ plans for theÂ future.",604-559-8155,BC,5,"In F2020,Â VTN ran VTP 6 times to help a total ofÂ 20 veterans. In past yearsÂ it hasÂ reachedÂ more thanÂ 100Â veterans, butÂ VTPÂ was cancelled for most of 2020 due to covid-19. To replace VTP during covid-19, VTN adapted the same clinical support to a 5-day format and called it theÂ Transition Skills Course. This programÂ ran 12 times in F2020 andÂ helped 60 veterans.",80,Veterans,www.vtncanada.org

Its mission is to improve the quality of life for people dealing with life-limiting illness, death, and bereavement. VHS runs a 17-bed inpatient unit at Royal Jubilee Hospital for respite care, pain and symptom management, and ongoing end-of-life care. It also runs a 24-7 home care program, offers bereavement and counselling services, conducts research on best practices in pain and symptom management for palliative care, and educates doctors, caregivers, and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) through training programs and workshops. VHS states that most of its services are free for clients. In keeping with BC government policies, there are daily charges for long-term and respite care beds in the in-patient unit at Royal Jubilee Hospital. The charity also states that some bereavement group services may include a charge to cover basic expenses.",250-370-8715,BC,5,"Victoria Hospice Society's in-patient unit admitted 455Â people in F2020. Although the majority (70%) of VHS' registered patients have cancer, VHS also helps people with diagnoses such as ALS or other chronic, progressive diseases. Referrals to the Hospice are made by Home & Community Care Nurses who work in partnership with VHS. The Hospice accepts patients in advanced stages of progressive illnesses who usually have a prognosis of six to 12 months. The unit has nine beds for ongoing end-of-life care (average length of stay ofÂ 24Â days in F2020) seven beds for pain and symptom management (average length of stay wasÂ 9Â days), and one bed for respite care to give caregivers one week of rest (average length of stay wasÂ 8Â days). The Palliative Response Team (PRT) is VHS's home care program. Nurses, who are on-call 24-7, provide consultation and treatment to palliative patients in the comfort of their own homes, as well as counselling for patients and families. The Palliative Response Team made 1,296Â home visits in F2020. Bereavement services are available to family members of registered patients as well as the general public.

As the longest-serving womenâs organization in Calgary, the charity has been working to improve the safety and treatment of women for over a century. YW runs four main programs: transitional housing, counselling and family resources, crisis shelter and outreach, and language and employment services.
In F2021, YW allocated 37% of program spending toÂ transitional and community housingÂ and 26% toÂ crisis shelter and outreach. Together, these programs work to support women leaving abuse or suffering from homelessness. TheÂ charity offers womenÂ short-term crisis shelter, long-term transitional housing, and three years of one-on-one guidance. Some housing is designated for single women, while other options provide space for moms and children. In October 2020, YW announced that it handed its community housing buildings to new service providers and will no longer provide support. The charity says it is glad to have provided long-term supportive housing for over 70 women before ending the program. YW continues to offer transitional housing services and emergency shelter.
Counselling, childcare, and family resourceÂ programs made up 29% of program spending in F2021. Counselling is available for women, men, children, and families to help them build healthy relationships, develop positive parenting skills, increase emotional stability, reduce stress, and heal from trauma. By offering flexible childcare, parents can work or access YW programming. In F2021, YW provided 600 hours of group counselling, 1,800 family outreach sessions, and 300 workshops for parents and families.
